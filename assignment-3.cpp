  // Constructors
  // Here you need a default constructor, and a parameterised constructor

  // Destructor

  // Getter functions (accessors) to 
  // This should include function returning beta value 

  // Setter functions, to change value of data members
  // Make sure you check input validity before changing something
  // Hint: you can use the input checking functions you used in assignment 1

  // Function to print info about a particle
  void print_data();

};

// Implementation of print_data function goes here

// End of particle class and associated member functions

// Beginning of detector class

// Functionalities needed, in addition to constructor/destructor/setters/getters (see slides on BB):
// - write a function that takes a particle 
//   and returns a bool and a print-out on whether this type of detector detected the particle
//   depending on the detector/particle combination (see slides on BB)
// - have data members that keep track of how many particles were detected by this particular detector, 
//   and of which type
// - write a function (accessor) that prints how many particles passed through this detector

// End of detector class

// Main program
int main()
{

  // Create the following particles: 
  // two electrons, four muons, three taus, one antielectron, one antimuon, one antitau 
  // Use the parameterised constructor

  // Print out the data from all the particles (put them in a vector)

  // Create the following detectors: a tracker, a calorimeter, a muon chamber

  // Pass the list of particles into each detector

  // Print a summary of how many particles were detected

  return 0;
